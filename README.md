# GitHub Topics Scraper : Project Overview


## Introduction:

*Web scraping* is the process of parsing and extracting data from the websites. It is very useful when we want to collect data from the websites for our work. 

GitHub is web-based version control and collaboration platform for software developers. It has a page https://github.com/topics where we can find different topics listed on GitHub.

I have built a scraper i.e., [Github_topics_scraper](https://github.com/Abhishek-2505/Github_topics_scraper/blob/main/github_topics_scraper.py) which scrapes the GitHub Topics webpage and gives us the data frame based on the user preferences.
